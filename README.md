# Databases in 2025
Article link: [Why PostgreSQL Remains the Top Choice for Developers in 2025](https://www.yugabyte.com/blog/postgresql-top-choice-in-2025/).

## My Thoughts
I found this article interesting because I only started coding about three years ago, and PostgreSQL was not something I discovered organically, but rather something I was pointed toward. When I was first choosing a database for some of my personal projects, I searched what was the most popular and reliable, and even tools like AI consistently recommended PostgreSQL. Reading this article helped me understand why the recommendation kept coming up: PostgreSQL is popular as it has strong fundementals, many active users, and continuous innovation (and also surprisingly easy to use and transfer).

Another thing I found interesting was how PostgreSQL compares to databases like MongoDB, which we used in Software Engineering. Mongo was more flexible and schema-less, which was helpful early on, but PostgreSQL's structured approach makes it feel more "serious" in a sense and scalable for some of my long-term designs. Overall, the article connected my personal learning path with broader industry trends, which made it especially easy to read.
